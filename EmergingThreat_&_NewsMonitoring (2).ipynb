      "\n",
      "A critical security vulnerability (CVSS score: 9.8), tracked as CVE-2023-32243, has been discovered in a popular Wordpress plugin Essential Addons for Elementor. This flaw could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges to that of any user on the WordPress site, as long as they know their username, thus being able to reset the password of the administrator and login on their account.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vulnerability occurs because the password reset function does not validate a password reset key and instead, directly changes the password of the given user. The issue has been fixed in the latest version of the plugin and it is crucial for website administrators to update to the patched version immediately.\n",

      "https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/ The cyber operations tracker categorizes all instances of publicly known state-sponsored cyber activity since 2005. The tracker only contains data in which the perpetrator, also known as the threat actor, is suspected to be affiliated with a nation-state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tracker focuses on state-sponsored actors because its purpose is to identify when states and their proxies conduct cyber operations in pursuit of their foreign policy interests. Furthermore, state-sponsored incidents generally have the most accurate and comprehensive reporting. Reporting on nonstate actors, such as hacktivist groups, tends to be murkier and makes for less reliable data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data exclusively tracks incidents and threat actors engaged in denial of service attacks, espionage, defacement, destruction of data, sabotage, and doxing. For term definitions, please see the glossary.\n",
      "\n",
      "All data collected for the tracker is open source. It is collected from existing repositories of state-sponsored incidents, such as Florian Roth’s APT Groups and Operations spreadsheet, the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ list of significant cyber events, and Kaspersky Lab’s Targeted Cyberattacks Logbook. This data was then supplemented with incidents and threat actors that were more recently disclosed in the media and by cybersecurity companies. Additional information was supplied by books, some of which provided more accurate in-depth reporting and detail. Where possible, efforts were made to link together the multiple aliases for various threat actors; one actor can be referred to in different ways by various cybersecurity companies. The tracker also attempts to identify which threat actors were responsible for a specific incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "The information contained in the data set comes from a combination of primary sources, such as government press releases and cybersecurity companies, and secondary sources, such as press reports and trade publications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tracker is updated quarterly. Changes will be made public via the Net Politics blog and will identify which incidents or threat actors were added, as well as any changes to data already in the tracker, such as changing the suspected state sponsor of an attack if new evidence is made public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tracker also has a feature that allows people to submit additional data. This crowdsourcing element allows cybersecurity firms and the general public to contribute incident or threat actor data to the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Known Limitations\n",
      "\n",
      "Attribution\n",
      "\n",
      "Attributing a cyber incident to a particular actor, let alone a state-sponsored actor, is a tricky and laborious process. The ability to attribute an incident has been the subject of longstanding debate within the cybersecurity community. Threat actors have been known to deliberately plant “false flags” in code to obfuscate attribution, use malware in the public domain to hide their tracks, and share code with allies. Although some cybersecurity companies expressly refuse to attribute cyber incidents to specific threat actors, a significant number of cybersecurity companies, researchers, and intelligence agencies can deduce [PDF] a threat actor’s responsibility by using a combination of technical data, open-source information, and an understanding of the threat actor’s foreign policy priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "This data set identifies suspected threat actors and their state sponsors based on what the reporting suggests and whether the tools, techniques, and procedures used by the threat actor conform to what is known about a state sponsor’s preferred methods of intrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Completeness of Data\n",
      "\n",
      "No claims are made that the data contained within the tracker is entirely complete. There are three reasons for this disclaimer.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, due to resource and language constraints, this database has an inherent bias toward over-reporting incidents or threat actors affecting countries where English is widely spoken, cybersecurity companies publish in English, or there is English-language media. This explains why most of the incidents in the data set identify victims in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the database relies on publicly accessible data. State intelligence agencies and private cybersecurity firms are likely to have the most complete data about state-sponsored actors, but may not make what they know public to protect national security or trade secrets. Furthermore, some reporting from the media or cybersecurity companies can be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to confirm incidents for which data is only available from a single source.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, complete and accurate information about cyber incidents and threat actors take time to emerge. For example, the attack on TV5 Monde in 2015 was initially believed to be the work of a terrorist-affiliated group calling itself the Cyber Caliphate. Months later, further evidence surfaced that French intelligence suspected Russian intelligence was behind the operation. It is also probable that, in some instances, state actors have masqueraded as non-state groups and have yet to be unmasked. Investigating cyber incidents is an iterative process that involves chasing leads and testing hypotheses. For this reason, it is possible that information about incidents or threat actors could change as new evidence comes to light. It is also possible that some state-sponsored incidents have been missed entirely.\n",

      "\n",
      "Symantec researchers observed the North Korea-linked group Kimsuky using a new Linux backdoor dubbed Gomir. The malware is a version of the GoBear backdoor which was delivered in a recent campaign by Kimsuky via Trojanized software installation packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kimsuky cyberespionage group (aka Springtail, ARCHIPELAGO, Black Banshee, Thallium, Velvet Chollima, APT43) was first spotted by Kaspersky researcher in 2013. The APT group mainly targets think tanks and organizations in South Korea, other victims were in the United States, Europe, and Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023 the state-sponsored group focused on nuclear agendas between China and North Korea, relevant to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gomir and GoBear share a great portion of their code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers from South Korean security firm S2W first uncovered the compaign in February 2024, the threat actors were observed delivering a new malware family named Troll Stealer using Trojanized software installation packages. Troll Stealer supports multiple stealing capabilities, it allows operators to gather files, screenshots, browser data, and system information. The malicious code is written in Go, and researchers noticed that Troll Stealer contained a large amount of code overlap with earlier Kimsuky malware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Troll Stealer can also copy the GPKI (Government Public Key Infrastructure) folder on infected computers. GPKI is the public key infrastructure schema for South Korean government personnel and state organizations, suggesting that government agencies were among the targeted by state-sponsored hackers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The malware was distributed inside the installation packages for TrustPKI and NX_PRNMAN, software developed by SGA Solutions. Victims downloaded the packages from a page that was redirected from a specific website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symantec also discovered that Troll Stealer was also delivered in Trojanized Installation packages for Wizvera VeraPort.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WIZVERA VeraPort integration installation program is used to manage additional security software (e.g., browser plug-ins, security software, identity verification software, etc.) that is requested to visit particular government and banking domains. WIZVERA VeraPort is used to digitally sign and verify downloads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wizvera VeraPort was previously reported to have been compromised by a supply chain attack conducted by North Korea-linked group Lazarus.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Troll Stealer appears to be related to another recently discovered Go-based backdoor named GoBear. Both threats are signed with a legitimate certificate issued to “D2innovation Co.,LTD”. GoBear also contains similar function names to an older Springtail backdoor known as BetaSeed, which was written in C++, suggesting that both threats have a common origin.” reads the report published by Symantec.\n",
      "\n",
      "When executed, the malware checks the group ID value to determine if it is running as group 0 (group is associated with the superuser or administrative privileges) on the Linux machine, and then copies itself to /var/log/syslogd to maintain persistence persistence.\n",
      "\n",
      "It creates a systemd service named ‘syslogd’ and starts it, then deletes the original executable and terminates the initial process. The backdoor also attempts to configure a crontab command to run on system reboot by creating a helper file (‘cron.txt’) in the current directory. If the crontab list is successfully updated, the malware deletes the helper file without any command-line parameters before executing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gomir backdoor periodically communicates with its C2 via HTTP POST requests to http://216.189.159[.]34/mir/index.php\n",
      "\n",
      "The malicious code pools the commands to execute, and the researchers observed it supporting multiple commands. including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Operation Description 01 Pauses communication with the C&C server for an arbitrary time duration. 02 Executes an arbitrary string as a shell command (“[shell]” “-c” “[arbitrary_string]”). The shell used is specified by the environment variable “SHELL”, if present. Otherwise, a fallback shell is configured by operation 10 below. 03 Reports the current working directory. 04 Changes the current working directory and reports the working directory’s new pathname. 05 Probes arbitrary network endpoints for TCP connectivity. 06 Terminates its own process. This stops the backdoor. 07 Reports the executable pathname of its own process (the backdoor executable). 08 Collects statistics about an arbitrary directory tree and reports: total number of subdirectories, total number of files, total size of files 09 Reports the configuration details of the affected computer: hostname, username, CPU, RAM, network interfaces, listing each interface name, MAC, IP, and IPv6 address 10 Configures a fallback shell to use when executing the shell command in operation 02. Initial configuration value is “/bin/sh”. 11 Configures a codepage to use when interpreting output from the shell command in operation 02. 12 Pauses communication with the C&C server until an arbitrary datetime. 13 Responds with the message “Not implemented on Linux!” (hardcoded). 14 Starts a reverse proxy by connecting to an arbitrary control endpoint. The communication with the control endpoint is encrypted using the SSL protocol and uses messages consistent with https://github.com/kost/revsocks.git, where the backdoor acts as a proxy client. This allows the remote attacker to initiate connections to arbitrary endpoints on the victim network. 15 Reports the control endpoints of the reverse proxy. 30 Creates an arbitrary file on the affected computer. 31 Exfiltrates an arbitrary file from the affected computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gomir and GoBear Windows backdoor supports almost the same commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest Kimsuky campaign highlights that North Korean espionage actors increasingly favor software installation packages and updates as infection vectors. The experts noticed a shift to software supply chain attacks through trojanized software installers and fake software installers. A prominent example is the 3CX supply chain attack, stemming from the earlier X_Trader attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This latest Springtail campaign provides further evidence that software installation packages and updates are now among the most favored infection vectors for North Korean espionage actors.” concludes the report. “Springtail, meanwhile, has focused on Trojanized software installers hosted on third-party sites requiring their installation or masquerading as official apps. The software targeted appears to have been carefully chosen to maximize the chances of infecting its intended South Korean-based targets.”\n",
